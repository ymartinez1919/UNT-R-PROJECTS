<p>In this task, you will be using the <strong><code>train_data</code></strong> dataset to run a linear regression that takes ‘weight’ as the dependent variable and all the other columns as the predictor.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You will use the <strong><code>lm()</code></strong> function to estimate your linear model and name it as <strong><code>linearmodel</code></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <strong><code>predict()</code></strong> function to predict the ‘weight’ variable in the <strong><code>test_data</code></strong> dataset using <strong><code>linearmodel</code></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Store the resulting predictions in a new object called <strong><code>predicted_weights</code></strong>.</p></li>
